    <li>1 cup buttermilk/kefir</li>
    <li>1 cup and 1 Tbsp flour</li>
    <li>1/8 tsp Kosher salt</li>
    <li>1 tsp sugar</li>
    <li>2/3 cup milk</li>
    <li>1/2 tsp baking soda</li>
    <li>2 Tbsp olive oil + oil for frying
        +
        Stick of cold butter to oil ready blini</li>

   </ul>
   <h2>Steps</h2>
   <ol>
    <li> Slightly beat the eggs, add 1/2 cup buttermilk, salt, sugar, and oil, mix until sugar and salt completely dissolve.
    </li>
    <li>Add all flour and make a rather thick batter. Mix rapidly until there are no lumps and the batter looks smooth.
        Tip: When making blini it's much faster to make a thick batter first, then dilute it with liquids.</li>
    <li>Now, add the remaining buttermilk, sprinkle with baking soda, stir well, and finally mix in milk in 1/3 cup portions.</li>
    <li>Let the batter sit for a few minutes to form gas bubbles that will give airy texture to blini.</li>
    <li>Sprinkle skillet with oil, pour scoup about half of soup ladle of batter.</li>
    <li>Cook on one side until the surface becomes mat and bubbles form.
    </li>
    <li>Flip over and finish on the other side.</li>
    <li>When ready, flip it over to a heat-resistant dish - second side up. This side is smoother and easier to butter. Quickly butter your blin with a half-undressed butter stick, and immediately start another blin.</li>
   </ol>
