    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>1 lb beef (sirloin, ribeye, or tenderloin), thinly sliced </li>
        <li>1 tablespoon olive oil</li>
        <li>1 onion, sliced</li>
        <li>8 oz sliced mushrooms</li> 
        <li>2 tablespoons butter</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons all-purpose flour</li>
        <li>2 cups beef broth</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon Dijon mustard</li>
        <li>1/2 cup sour cream</li>
        <li>Salt and pepper to taste</li>
        <li>Egg noodles, cooked, for serving</li>
      </ul>
      <h2>Steps</h2>
      <ol>
        <li>Brown the beef: Season beef with salt and pepper. Heat olive oil in a skillet over medium-high heat. Brown beef in batches, without overcrowding the pan. Remove beef and set aside.</li>
        <li>Saut√© vegetables: Add sliced onion and mushrooms to the pan. Cook until softened, about 5 minutes.</li>
        <li>Make the sauce: Melt butter in the skillet, whisk in flour and cook for 1 minute. Slowly add broth, whisking to avoid lumps. Stir in Dijon mustard, then bring to a simmer and cook until sauce slightly thickens (about 5 minutes).</li>
        <li>Finish the Stroganoff: Return the beef to the pan and simmer for a few minutes to warm through. Turn off heat and stir in sour cream (do not let the sour cream boil). Season with salt and pepper.</li>
        <li>Serve: Serve hot over cooked egg noodles.</li>
      </ol>
